# Lean 4 Web

This is a web version of Lean 4. The official lean playground is hosted at [live.lean-lang.org](https://live.lean-lang.org), while [lean.math.hhu.de](https://lean.math.hhu.de) hosts a development server testing newer features.

In contrast to the [Lean 3 web editor](https://github.com/leanprover-community/lean-web-editor), in this web editor, the Lean server is
running on a web server, and not in the browser.
